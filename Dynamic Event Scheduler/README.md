# Dynamic Event Scheduler

This is a simple conference event listing project created using
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Event details are stored in a static JavaScript array and displayed
as cards on the page using DOM manipulation.

Users can filter events by category (Workshop, Keynote, Panel)
and by time (Morning or Afternoon).

This project is created to practice basic JavaScript concepts
like arrays, filter(), and classList.toggle().
